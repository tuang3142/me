## [bit-converter](https://github.com/tuang3142/bit-converter)

Crypto and Fiat converter or my attempt to build a Ruby gem from a previous Python project. I had a lot of [fun]({% post_url 2021-08-18-gem-development %}) building this one thanks to `bundler` providing a framework. It had me realize that I take for granted how quickly a framework can help set up a development, and also how I need to read code more often to know how things (mainly Rails) just work together magically. Last but not least, [making CLI is super, super fun]({% post_url 2021-08-19-gem-development-2 %}).

## [sudoku](https://github.com/tuang3142/sudoku)

The classic sudoku solver, but fast, and with [CLI]({% %}). I used to solve [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/) with my eyes close. However, to set up a repository, to write good tests, and to make a good design out of it is a completely different story. This is the first project I applied test-driven development and some design patterns from [poodr](https://www.poodr.com/).

## [1337](https://github.com/tuang3142/1337)

This is my collection of leetcode problems. Occasionally, I'll write algorithms and data structures from scratch. The purpose is to practice and showcase clean code with explanation and complexity analysis. I primarily use Python over Ruby (which I use professionally) because Python supports a wider range of libraries for solving algorithmic problems.


## [redditor](https://github.com/tuang3142/redditor)

CLI browser for Reddit. This is my first ever CLI software and published package. It still works surprisingly well after all those years.
