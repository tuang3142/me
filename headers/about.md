Hi! I'm Tuan Nguyen, a Web Developer (and Vim enthusiast) living in Sai Gon. I am most efficient with Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. My tech stack includes Ruby on Rails and React.

Currently, I am with [Remitano](https://remitano.com), where I build software for communication and management within the company. I also develop a fair amount of features for our main product: a leading crypto trading platform in Vietnam and Nigeria. Previously, I worked as Ruby on Rails developer at [Floating Cube Studio](https://floatingcube.com/) and [Employment Hero](https://employmenthero.com/).


In my free time, I enjoy [contributing](/feed/) to open-source projects, fantasizing about [good keyboards](need a link), and click clacking about Rails & Vim (thus the blog you're reading).

I prefer [email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) for a more formal conversation, but you can also drop me a quick message via [telegram](https://t.me/{{ site.author.telegram }}). If you're feeling extremely charitable, follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/).

My CV is available for download [here](../TuanNguyen-Resume.pdf).
