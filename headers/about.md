Hi! I'm Tuan Nguyen, a Web Developer (and Vim enthusiast) living in Sai Gon. I am most efficient with Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. My tech stack includes Ruby on Rails and React.

Currently, I am with [Remitano](https://remitano.com), where I build software for communication and management within the company. I also develop a fair amount of features for our main product: a leading crypto trading platform in Vietnam and Nigeria. Previously, I worked as Ruby on Rails developer at [Floating Cube Studio](https://floatingcube.com/) and [Employment Hero](https://employmenthero.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, fantasize about [good keyboards](need a link), and building new healthy habits [every month](/30-day-challenge/).

I'm best reach via [email](mailto:tuan.nguyenviet271@gmail.com) and [telegram](https://t.me/tuanguyenvi). If you're feeling extremely generous, follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tuang3142/).

My CV is available for download [here](../TuanNguyen-Resume.pdf).
