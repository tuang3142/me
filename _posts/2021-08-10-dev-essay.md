## What

What's the problem? What are you trying to communicate?

## Why

Why do the readers need this?

## How

How are you going to solve the problem? Or how would the tool you're writing about solve it?

## Conslusion

At Remitano, we use an essay template to write internally. A post would contain 3 to 4 headings that answer questions: `What`, `Why`, `How`. It's like a mini-paper. I find it a quick way to incite discussion but still can present my writing logically. Whenever I have an idea, I'd jot it down and start gathering people's thoughts.

Now I'm applying this to my blog. Thanks to the posts being short, I can start lazily and write regularly. They don't need to be deep and require a lot of effort, so the writing is easy enough to form a good writing habit. My goal is to write twice a week. I can always research and update the posts on weekends if needed.

Personally, I'd like to add a `Conclusion` session at the end. It seems like the right thing to do.
