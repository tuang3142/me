I dont like css and not very good at it (yet). But while making the CLI gem, i feels good.

It require a really good design thinking. Bite site, can be reviewed and reflect.

Perfect for learning a new language. I have deciced that whenever I learn a new language, I will make a cli out of it and intensively test it.

Easy to test and write test.

Heck, even cucumber supports testing with cli. Good to scale

It make CLI development more fun.

Next stop: ruby quiz with proper development.
